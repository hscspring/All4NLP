    "- Paths\n",
    "  - Adjacent vertices\n",
    "    - Two vertices are adjacent when they are both incident to a common edge. \n",
    "  - Path in an undirected Graph\n",
    "    - A path in an undirected graph is a sequence of vertices P = ( v1, v2, ..., vn ) ∈ V x V x ... x V such that vi is adjacent to v{i+1} for 1 ≤ i < n. Such a path P is called a path of length n from v1 to vn. \n",
    "    - (a,c,e,b,c,d) is a path but not a simple path\n",
    "  - Simple Path\n",
    "    - A path with no repeated vertices is called a simple path. \n",
    "    - (a, c, e) is a simple path\n",
    "\n",
    "- Degree\n",
    "  - Degree\n",
    "    - The degree of a vertex v in a graph is the number of edges connecting it, with loops counted twice.\n",
    "    - The degree of a vertex v is denoted deg(v). \n",
    "    - The maximum degree of a graph G, denoted by Δ(G), and the minimum degree of a graph, denoted by δ(G), are the maximum and minimum degree of its vertices. \n",
    "  - regular graph\n",
    "    - If all the degrees in a graph are the same, the graph is a regular graph. In a regular graph, all degrees are the same, and so we can speak of the degree of the graph. \n",
    "  - degree sum formular(Handshaking lemma)\n",
    "    - ∑v ∈ Vdeg(v) = 2 |E|\n",
    "    - the sum of degrees of all the vertices is equal to the number of edges multiplied by 2.\n",
    "    - We can conclude that **the number of vertices with odd degree has to be even.**（有奇数度的顶点个数一定是偶数）\n",
    "    - \"handshaking lemma\" stems from a popular mathematical problem: In any group of people the number of people who have shaken hands with an odd number of other people from the group is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Degree Sequence\n",
    "  - The degree sequence of an undirected graph is defined as the sequence of its vertex degrees in a non-increasing order. \n",
    "  - Isomorphic graphs have the same degree sequence.   \n",
    "  - However, two graphs with the same degree sequence are not necessarily isomorphic.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Erdös-Gallai theorem \n",
    "  - The Erdös-Gallai theorem states that a non-increasing sequence of n numbers di (for i = 1, ..., n) is the degree sequence of a simple graph if and only if the **sum of the sequence is even** and the **following condition** is fulfilled:   \n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^k d_i \\leqslant k(k-1) + \\sum_{i=k+1}^n min(d_i,k) \\quad for \\ k \\in {1,...,n}$$  \n",
    "  - 什么叫合法的度数序列？就是存在一个无重边无自环（简单）的无向图，使得图中每个点的度数构成的序列为给定的序列。\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph Density\n",
    "  - The graph density is defined as the ratio of the number of edges of a given graph, and the total number of edges, the graph could have.\n",
    "  - It measures how close a given graph is to a complete graph. \n",
    "  - $D = \\frac {\\lvert E \\rvert}{\\lvert V \\rvert(\\lvert V \\rvert -1)}$\n",
    "  - A dense graph is a graph in which the number of edges is close to the maximal number of edges. A graph with only a few edges, is called a sparse graph.\n",
    "  - The precisest mathematical notation uses the big O notation.\n",
    "  - A dense graph is a graph G = (V, E) in which |E| = Θ(|V|2). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Connected Graphs\n",
    "  - A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected.  \n",
    "  - It possible to determine with a simple algorithm whether a graph is connected:\n",
    "    - Choose an arbitrary node x of the graph G as the starting point\n",
    "    - Determine the set A of all the nodes which can be reached from x.\n",
    "    - If A is equal to the set of nodes of G, the graph is connected; otherwise it is disconnected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Distance and Diameter of a graph  \n",
    "  - The distance \"dist\" between two vertices in a graph is the length of the shortest path between these vertices. \n",
    "    - No backtracks, detours, or loops are allowed for the calculation of a distance. \n",
    "  - The eccentricity of a vertex s of a graph g is the maximal distance to every other vertex of the graph:   \n",
    "    - e(s) = max( { dist(s,v) | v ∈ V }), (V is the set of all vertices of g)   \n",
    "  - The diameter d of a graph is defined as the maximum eccentricity of any vertex in the graph.   \n",
    "    - **This means that the diameter is the length of the shortest path between the most distanced nodes.** \n",
    "    - 最短路径里面最长的那个就是图的直径。\n",
    "  - To determine the diameter of a graph,   \n",
    "    - first find the shortest path between each pair of vertices.   \n",
    "    - The greatest length of any of these paths is the diameter of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tree / Forest\n",
    "  - A tree is an undirected graph which contains no cycles（某条路径的起点和终点相同）. This means that any two vertices of the graph are connected by exactly one simple path. \n",
    "  - **A forest is a disjoint union of trees.**   \n",
    "  - Contrary to forests in nature, a forest in graph theory can consist of a single tree! \n",
    "  - A graph with one vertex and no edge is a tree (and a forest). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Spanning Tree\n",
    "  - A spanning tree T of a connected, undirected graph G is a subgraph G' of G, which is a tree, and G' contains all the vertices and a subset of the edges of G.   \n",
    "  - G' contains all the edges of G, if G is a tree graph.   \n",
    "  - Informally, a spanning tree of G is a selection of edges of G that form a tree spanning every vertex.   \n",
    "  - That is, every vertex lies in the tree, but no cycles (or loops) are contained.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hamiltonian Game\n",
    "  - An Hamiltonian path is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex **exactly once**.   \n",
    "  - A Hamiltonian cycle (or circuit) is a Hamiltonian path that is a cycle.   \n",
    "  - Note for computer scientists: Generally, it is not not possible to determine, whether such paths or cycles exist in arbitrary graphs, because the Hamiltonian path problem has been proven to be NP-complete. \n",
    "  - It is named after William Rowan Hamilton who invented the so-called \"icosian game\", or Hamilton's puzzle, which involves finding a Hamiltonian cycle in the edge graph of the dodecahedron.   \n",
    "  - Hamilton solved this problem using the icosian calculus, an algebraic structure based on roots of unity with many similarities to the quaternions, which he also invented. "
